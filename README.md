# Boyd & Goldberg (2011) replication using mixed effects models with the maximal random effects structure

This code fits a series of logit mixed models to data from Boyd and Goldberg (2011), Experiment 1. All models specify the maximal random effects structure, as advocated by Barr et al. (2013). All results from Boyd and Goldberg are replicated.
